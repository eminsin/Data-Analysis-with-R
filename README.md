# Data Analysis with R

+ The files above were created during the dates specified in each file by 
  + listening to a **1680 mins (28 hrs) lecture** by [Danny Arends](https://dannyarends.nl/?) from Humboldt University in Berlin,
  + scripting on **Notepad++** , executing on **R 4.1.1** and **R Studio** using the stardard libraries by **me, Erkam Minsin**.
+ The videos of the lecture are available on [Danny's youtube page](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxmF4P_O_2c&list=PLhR2Go-lh6X6ZJnN4WQScB4qjO4GYTO0S).
+  In this course, Data Analysis with R is taught and practiced with assignments.
+ The questions of the assignments are available in the PDF files, and the codes for the solutions in the codes.r files above.
